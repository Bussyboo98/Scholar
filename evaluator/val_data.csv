"In recent years, technology has been developing and people are busy keeping up with progress. For this reason, some people state that people, including students need to learn cutting-edge technology, such as IT program outweigh the importance of learning history. Furthermore, they often state there is no value of learning history. Although some people's opinions are understandable to some extent, I strongly believe people continuously need to learn history to recognize modern social issues. I would like to state some reasons and examples to support my opinion.
Initially, people have a long history of how they improved their lifestyles drastically and violently from ancient times around the world. People kept fighting to increase their country's territory and caused innumerable victims. In addition, there were slaves who were occupied by invaders. As a result, they were often forced to move to another continent, such as America for the workforce and looked down on slaves. If people ignore learning this historical background, they will continue fighting and discriminating against them. Therefore, learning history will lead to how necessary to treat human rights equally.
Secondly, when it comes to the environment, there are several issues. Some disasters and global warming are triggered by human's sustainable long historical actions. After the Industrial Revolution that occurred in the 18th century, we consumed a lot of resources such as oil and coal, and the carbon dioxide emissions caused climate change such as global warming.
In addition, repeated deforestation led to floods and a sharp decline in native species. Unless people know the reason why such a revolution happened by history, people will take another action that is harmful to the global environment.
Finally, the causes of our modern society's problems as I mentioned above can be recognized by studying history. People need to take responsibility for a peaceful and eco-friendly society by considering a variety of views in history.",6.0
"Most world-class museums are free in London, but some museums and art galleries around the world have an admission charges. Frankly speaking, museums with free entry do not mean no cost incurred in their operation. In contrary, there is a lot of maintenance expenditure on exhibits of museums, particularly on historical paintings and valuable statues. These costs are funded by the governments in order to provide the welfare to their civilians. Some people advocate all museums and art galleries should charge the entrance fees as the public funding have to be spent in dire need of foods and housing in the community. This essay attempts to find out its benefits against costs.
There is no doubt that thousand millions expenditure in the operating of museums are financed by the local governments. The UK government reportedly spends almost 500 million pounds a year on supporting the cultural and artistic life of the country. Some people object to this expenditure, arguing that it is unfair to devote much tax payers' money to things which only appeal to a minority of people. They think these attractions should be self-funding, in other words, museums and galleries should set an entrance fee which cover their costs, besides, these costs are reflected via a realistic amount for tickets. The public funds saved could then be spent on more important matters such as housing or providing better educational facilities.
Nevertheless, the culture and arts are not a trivial matter but a vital part of a nation's identity. Not only the arts have a key educational role by representing the traditions and heritage of people, but also galleries and museums should be freely available to all, rich or poor. It is clear that this is basic welfare to all citizens in a country. From economic aspects, tourism can be drived by these attractions. A case in point is British museum, which appeals an endless influx of tourists from various parts of the world to visit every year. Therefore, they are responsible for a significant amount of employment.
My take on this is that the governments have a responsibility to support a range of cultural and artistic activities and to make the museums and galleries free available to all their civilians despite many demanding on their funding resources in the community.",6.5
"Education is an important requirement for students establishing their future, thus there is a considerable debate about whether the government should give fully supported payment for university courses to people who want to study at there. In my view, I partially agree with this statement because this is a beneficial scheme, but the selection of scheme participants is required for filtering those who really need this assistance.
On the one hand, it is a definite good plan for those families are low income. A completed bachelor's degree course may cost over 10 thousand dollars. However, some grassroots families are hard to afford it. So they may tend to not study at universities but find a job for earning money. After that, college may lose some potentially intelligent students. Therefore, if this scheme can be implemented successfully, those students will show their ingenuity and get higher academic achievement, finally giving back to society when they succeed.
On the other hand, this scheme is not suitable for everyone. qualification checking is needed for choosing someone who truly aspires to an opportunity to study at college. For example, setting a line indicating the limit of the monthly income of a family is a way for the government to distinguish who is needed to help. Because the cost of the study is also a type of ""inspiration"" for students studying harder. If a family was proven to be able to afford the fees, the government would not give assistance to them in order to avoid abusive use.
In summary, although this scheme is advantageous for low-income families, revealing their children's inherent power, the government can set some rules for filtering those who are necessary for help.",7.0
"The line graph illustrate the way the Tourist Information Office had recieved their enquiries over a six month period in one city.
It is clear that the number of enquiries recieved by telephone and in person had a significant increase, while the one recieved by letter or an email had a noticable decrease.
Starting from January the in person enquiries was the lowest in number compared to other ways, although the office recieved only 400 enquires in person at January, there was a dramatical increase of in person enquires, reaching 1900 in June. Moreover, enquires recieved by telephone had a significant raise as well. It started at 900 in January and rose up to 1600 in June. On the other hand, inquires recieved by letter or email had a noticable decrease over the six months, it started at 750 in January, and ended up with almost 300 im may then stood with the same figure in June.",6.5
"In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.
English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.
In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.
In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.",6.5
"In the modern society,it is seen that the buildings in the housing areas vary from one city to the other city where some cities prefer taller buildings and other cities prefer smaller buildings on a wide land.
This essay illustrates the reason why they are built in this way and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each type of building.
It is often said that the taller buildings are ideal for houses in metropolitan cities.The main reasons are the cost of land and a very large population in big cities.As a solution for this problem,people in big cities prefer taller buildings where the homes are easily affordable for them.However,this leads to over crowding and lack of adequate ventilation.For instance,in Mumbai,the largest city in India,the cost of land and the population is so high that the majority of the constuction companies build taller buildings in order to solve this problem.
In contrast,some cities with a lower population and comparatively lower cost of land build shorter buildings on a wide land.This enables cities to prevent over crowding in communities and have a wider open area with greenery providing a lot of ventilation helping people to lead a better life style.For example,in Chandigarh,a union territory in India,the construction of houses are perfectly executed providing enough space between each house as the cost of land and the population is relatively low when compared to cities like Mumbai.
To summarise,some cities with high cost of land and the high population prefer taller buildings lacking adequate ventilation and leading to overcrowding where as the in the cities with the opposite situation ,the houses are built on a larger piece of land providing adequate space between each house.",8.5
"The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.
Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.
Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.
The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.",5.5
"Nowadays, due to increasing of crime rate, some people tend to think of the best way to decline crime is giving a longer prison sentences. However, some criticisms probably believe that there should have much better ways to decrease crime. In my opinion, that is true to some extent for this statement. That means the prison sentences may be necessary, but I perfer the other ways such as education and detenion center rather than the prison sentences, especially for minors.
Firstly, it is possible to said that increasing the punishment would decline the crime in the society. Considering the fact that most of citizens afraid to lose their freedom as a longer time. Given the circumstance, Hong Kong goverment established a policy which force people to scan the QR code with the Leave Home Safe app for against the Covid-19, it was not very common initially without any punishment, yet after announcing the 10-year prison sentences amd 60-throusand-dollar fines, HongKongers use the app quite often now. So that probably means that the more punlishment they will get, the more attentive and cautious they will have.
On the other hand, it seem likely to have another proper ways to reduce the crimes . One example is creat a better and well-rounded education for people, particularly for youngsters. Some people could think of it is a more efficient way to develop and nurture thier manner for their whole life. For example, there are a lot of different kind of extra curriculums which consist of having a talk with polices and ICAC for students to join and teach them some form of concept to be a good citizen and take their responsibilities living in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it can show them some societal expectation rather than arresting them and destroy their future.
To summarize, there are different opinions for this statement. Even so, I believe that if we had spoon-feed information and set a better model for people, it will help people to reflect on their bad behaviour. Likewise, if goverment only established a lot of punishment for his residents consisently, they may feel stress out. It is probably not good for a long term development for a morden as well as international city and country.",6.5
"The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.
Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.
Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.
In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.",5.5

"The line graphs compare the enrollments of students from overseas and local areas in Australian universities between 2001and 2010.
It is clear that the total number of enrollment of local students was always higher than that of overseas students. While the commencing number of local students remained stable, the number of the enrollments of students from overseas saw an upward trend.
In 2001, while the commencing figure for enrollments of students from overseas was approximately 16000, the number of those coming from local regions was around 170000, more than 10 times of the figure for the former. There was a huge gap from the total number of students enrolled from overseas and local areas in 2001, with 20000 and 400000 respectively.

"The given flow chart demostrates the effects of deforestation on nature. These influences can occur through four possible routes.
First, one of the initial impacts of such activity is when heavy logging instruments compress the soil, making it hard and baked. Thus, rain water may run off and eventually resulting in flooding. Secondly, with clear cutting of forests, there is a decrease in roots that hold the top soil in it. This will lead to soil erosion.
Moreover, deforestaion is belived to rise the likelihood of burning, either delibrately or accidentally. As waste food from logging is destroyed, some micro-organisms that feed on it might vanish. Other species get in the field, causing a degradation of vegetation. This could be also a result of soil erosion or an increase of drought. All of these events are responsible for less biodiversity. Finally, a decrease in plants means less moisture to air, less precipitation and more exacerbation of drought.
Overall, as is shown by this chart, the deforestation process has substantial repersussions on nature through various ways. Unless any decrease of this detrimental activity, nature would witness flooding, soil erosions, less biodiversity and severe drought.",7.5
"This line graph illustrate the comparison between the oil that was produced and consumpted in China from 1982 to 2006. The data is given in millions of oil barriels per day.
The first thing to note is how consumption has surpassed by far the production levels, even though at first both started at a similar point.
On one side, consumption remained at a very low growth from 1982 until 1990, barely crossing the 2 million of oil barrels' threeshold. From that point on it skyrocketed, surpassing consumption in less than 4 years, although in 1994 the tendency slowed down. On the other hand, production experienced an increase from 1982 to 1986, but then leveled off at 3 million oil barrels. Since then there hasn't been any remarkable change, only a small positive trend starting in 1994 that hasn't stopped yet.
Overall, it can be said that in a span of 24 years, consumption has almost doubled the production data.",6.5
"The chart provides information about air pollution rates and its various culprits in four different countries, namely China, America, Japan, and Australia, during 2021.
Overall, the country with the highest rate of PPM was China, in contrary to Australia with the lowest rate. Roughly, electricity generation seems to be the least common cause of pollution, whilst transportation and pollution from industry seems to have similar levels of PPM.
Japan and China's PPM trend seems alike, with industry ranking the first in PPM level contribution, transportation ranking second, and electricity generation coming third. China's industry, transportation, and electrical generation was roughly 80 PPM, 70 PPM, and 60 PPM respectively, while all of Japan's pollution causes levels are approximately half of China's, with industry contributing a little more than 40PPM, transportation with 30 PPM, and electricity generation with around 15 PPM.
Australia and America, on the other hand, shows no similar patterns to any countries in this chart. America's highest pollution contribution was transporation, with a similar level to that of China's electricity generation, with almost 60 PPM.

"Taking about bullying its more important every day. I think that now a days our society is experiencing a transformation of values and with these transformation a lot of thes important values are saturating to get forgotten.
I think that the first solution has to come from the house, with the parents. It's critical that parents are properly informed about these situation and have the correct preparation to Handel it.
Continuing with the idea of the first step has to come from house, the school were your child is attending they could give a seminary about bulling and the consequences. And inform parents that the school will have zero tolerance in this cases.
Also i think that you have to make aware your child about these situation and talk to them. Explain why its not good to bullying someone because there race, color or the way they think. Tell them that a show of maturity is to learn to respect the different thinking of people.
Like ones president Benito Juárez said ""The respect to the right of others is the peace"".
When i was at elementary these term wasn't around but it doesn't mean that bulling doesn't exist. In may days it was common that someone was bulling another student but the times it happened these students, stand for them selves so that's were it was over.
So also teach your child to learn to defend themselves and to no tolerate these type of behavior. Tache them that they will always can come to talk to you and help them solve these types of situations and also if they are wittnes of these type of behavior, to don't be indifferent and take a posture of defend the other child.
These could be by going with a authority ( teacher, principal, etc) or to try to stop it.",5.0

"A tremendous number of people believe that country's authorities are responsible for the rise in obesity in kids. However, there are both truth and falsehoods in this controversial statement, which will be discussed in this essay.
A lot of people may agree with this because they think that the government does not take measures to stop selling high sugar products, which may cause obesity, in schools. Moreover, they may suggest that government is also responsible for junk food advertisements because it is not forbidden yet. For instance, if children see a french fries and hamburgers advertisement in cartoons they are watching, they may want to eat fast food every day to be like their favourite cartoon character who enjoys the same meal.
On the other hand, some people are convinced that only parents are responsible for their own kids. They understand that children's food and sports habits are similar to those which their parents have. For example, if human beings explain to their kids how food influences physical and mental health and cook fresh, healthy dishes for the whole family every day, no one will want to buy fast food or even overeat.
In conclusion, the government is responsible the same as parents are. From my point of view, children's obesity is a huge problem that is difficult to solve in the modern world because of a lot of different factors. Nevertheless, if the government allows selling only healthy food in schools, and parents teach kids to do physical exercises and eat junk food only on holidays, obesity in children may have a chance to decrease with time.",7.0
"In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.
There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.
On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.
All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.",6.0
"Rapid adavancement in technology is a serous disruptor of traditional cultures. The author agree with the statement that the technology and traditional cultures may find it hard to co-exist. As the reserach and development of human beings increases the birth of new technologies are inevitable. When a new technology is invented, mostly the new member of our living environment disrupts the traditional standards.
For example, prior to the internet era we used to communicate less through the mobile devices and tend to have face to face conversations. This is often true while considering a chat between our family members. On occasions like birthday, a festival season like Christmas we used to go in person to greet the loved ones. However, as technology evolved and traditional jobs are swept away people migrated to locations with more opportunities and often these are far from the native places. This situation along with the communication platforms built above internet like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat make us feel like we do not have to travel so far just to wish for a special occasion when we can do the same easily on a mobile device.
From the authors experience it is clearly understood that he traditional cultures are now covered by the clouds of new technologies which threatens the survival of many hunam beings. For example, with the innovation in the banking sector, the customers are now able to transact through their mobile application. They do not have to visit the brick and mortar braches anymore. If this trend continues then many professionals in the banking industry will be laid of within next couple of years.",5.0
"Nowadays, due to the development in science and technology, expolring the remote natural places has become available. Exploring is what scientists and tourists are always like and eager to do because, invariably, unknown keeps an attraction of mystery. However, there are pros and cons in travelling to remote natural environment.
As far as we know, the improvement in science and progress in technology always comes from exploring the unknown destinations. Travelling to a remote natural environment, take the South Pole for example, can conduct many research which cannot be done in common places. These kinds of research is helpful in Biology and in finding the origin of human being. The second biggest advantage is that it can improve the tourism in its local area, and tourism means a better condition for local people. In the past, in some remote places of China without torism, the native people there had a poor sanitory condition and after the arrivals of travellers, people there can earn a living and improve their living conditions.
However, everything in the world has its donwside. The activities in scientific research and commerce will cause contalmination to the environment in remote places. For instance, the constructions of the scientific stations have occupied the places where many wild animals there used to call home. There is no doubt that such activities will lead to a decrease in the number of these animals which will also influent the local ecosystem.
To sum up, the travel to remote natural environment will not only help to improve the development of science but also help with the local tourism, but the disadvantage is that these activities will cause damages to the local environment.",7.5
"Living in both big cities and regional towns have their own advantages and disadvantages. Although, regional towns are small and provide a simple lifestyle, I still think that large cities offer a better lifestyle and much better facilities.
It is true that regional towns have a simpler lifestyle and are not completely industrialized, which leads to a better environment and healthier people. Some people say that large cities have a few problems like traffic and high population. I, however, believe that the advantages of living in a big city, completely outweigh the disadvantages.
Firstly, Due the modernisation and globalisation of industries, various multinational companies look for employees and are usually situated in urban areas. People move from rural areas to urban towns to look for employment with higher salaries as well as international exposure. Secondly, cities have a vast network of transportation available which is more frequent and comfortable for the commuters. Many people from small towns transit through big cities for inter-state or international travels. Lastly, large towns provide better accommodation for people with better living facilities. They have huge buildings with many apartments which are very well structured. These buildings also have facilites like gym, pools, grocery shops e.t.c. so that residents don't have to travel far. Which is why, when people move from small towns, it is easier for them to rent a room according to their budget and requirements.
In conclusion, While I strongly believe that one should visit regional towns from time to time to freshen up their mind and body, I completely disagree with the fact that people should be encouraged by the government to permanently move to these areas .",6.5
"Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.
On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.
On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.
In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.",5.0
"Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.
First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.
Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.
To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.",7.0

"Some people argue that gay marriage it is a trend that might negatively affect society. Controversially, some others believe that same-sex marriages are natural and people have the right to choose this kind of marriage. This essay discusses why gay marriage should not be defined as a trend but regarded as a people's right, thus as a legal marriage.
During the last few years, several arguments arose against or in favour of same-sex marriage. For decades, people believed that gay people should not be allowed to get married as it was considered against the traditional image of a family. For example, same-sex people wouldn't be able to love and care for a child as a traditional family could. The belief behind this thought is related to the patriarchal educational concept where a child needs to grow in the presence of a mother and a father. Thus, same-sex relations are considered not natural by some people. Considering the definition of love and what caring for someone involves in, isn't indicated that same-sex people cannot feel and express love to each other and care for someone. Love is a feeling that goes beyond the gender. As such, people have the right to love and get married.
,
hence, due to the presence of such a patriarchal belief in most of the world's countries, gay marriage isn't a legal right yet. In a world where people express the need to be more democratic, politically correct and free from biases and discrimination, same-sex marriage should be globally legalised. As such, a change of mindset might be needed. for example, people should begin to see marriage as an expression of love rather than a right and moral action to procreate.
To sum up, while for some people same-sex marriage is only a trend that should could impact the society, for some others, gay marriage it is a natural expression of love. Thus, marriage should be allowed regardless the gender and people's sexual-orientation. govemrnts. should support and legalised same-sex marriage.",6.5
"There are various numbers of countries that are rich from an economic weath such as petroleum, gas, and minerals. In this essay, I disagree that lucrative wealth makes citizens careless about anything because they are developing their country. Additionally, I will talk about how economic wealth had changed the life of people in their countires. There are numerous reasons why economic wealth is prominent even though if the country is rich they could be richer.
Firstly, the higher the remunerative wealth makes life easy for citizens. Because now it is difficult to find jobs, therefore, these profitable companies could afford you one in your rich country. Some people may believe that people would be careless, that is not true. Because people are the main purposes of making this wealth, and they also want to develop their country and make it more knownable for the rest of life. Moreover, living in a rich country gives a priority for a good life.
Furthermore, the increase of economic wealth changes the view of other countires and citizens. Having a high economic wealth could change the life of people. All of the people are greedy no matter what you do they want more and more, therefore, people are developing their county to have a high salary and live a tranquil life.
To conclude, having an increase of economic wealth in a country changes the lives of citizens. People are trying to develop the countries to make it more knownable and a prominent figure in life. Meanwhile, people are greedy they want more that what they deserve so by the increase of lurcative wealth they could get higher than what they deserve.",5.0
"There is no doubt that rewarding employees wirh extra money can have positive effects on the quality of work. However, there are many different ways is which employers can implement to increase theit employees satisfaction in the work environment. In this essay, I will discuss why money incetives can be beneficial, and mention different alternatives.
Rewarding employees with money is one of the best ways to guarantee employees retantion and prevent employees tunrover. This is because most people work to provide better life for them and their families, and extra money can help them achieve that. As a result, companies can increase their employees satisfaction and encourage them turn off job offers. For example, yearly bounses are one of the main incentives to encourage people to work harder. However, companies who do not pay enough bounses can loss many special employees.
While money is considerd as one of the main reasons why employees are satisfied, it can add extra expenses on the companies, which can affect their future success. Managers can use different ways to encourage employees to work harder by saying thank you or giving them extra day off after a long project, which can have a positive effect on the work quality. For instance, in some private companies in Saudi Arabia, managers usually reward their staff by giving them day off when there is an important football match or when the weather is great.
In conclusion, while money incentives can reduce employees turnover, not all companies have the ability to implement this soultion. However, a much cheaper incentives can be used to achieve the same results.",5.5
"Throughout modern history there have always been professional and gifted individuals from developed countries who aspire to immigrate into more developed societies. Recently this trend has been more emphatic resulting in a disputable discussion which has been widely talked about. Should rich governments permit local workplaces to recruit foreign employees? I personally agree with this point of view and I will elaborate on the reasons in this essay.
There are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries. First, foreign employees can bring with them new innovations and methods of research which in turn will enrich the local markets and possibly contribute to enhancing the knowledge. In addition, foreign employers are generally paid lower income in comparison to local workers, this could save up money for other investments. Moreover, a swarm of skilled immigrants will probably increase the competition among local employers and encourage them to improve in different aspect in order to secure employment.
There are other aspects which merit consideration. Most of the foreign employers would utilize their occupation in the developed countries in improving their skills and knowledge and might consider going back to their homelands. This knowledge transfer would probably benefit both sides. As developed nations will employ the new comers and harness their experience in developing the education, health and other forms. Interestingly, this prosperity in developed countries will presumably lower the influx of unemployed and illiterate immigrants into the rich countries.
To conclude, I agree with the title statement regarding the several advantages of such an action. Historically, if rich countries had adopted skilled people from poor nations, there would have probably been fewer immigrants into their developed countries with all the know repercussions of this phenomenon.",7.5
"Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.
International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.
It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.
In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.",7.0
"Some people share the view, that for minimising criminality offenders should go to jail for a long time while others are of the view, that this problem should be tackled by using alternatives solutions. I believe, that the judicial system should look for other ways to punish criminals depending on the severity of the offence.
Firstly, by keeping people encarcelated for years, 'the problem is locked up' and there is no need to dealt with it until the sentence is served. For instance, for individuals who have committed a serious crime such as murder, a long sentence is appropriate due to the severity of it and the criminal's possible danger for the society. On the contrary, for little criminals, like robbery, mild sentences or social hours should be considered as an option.
On the other hand, by trying to get these individuals before they commit a severe crime, could be a clever step. For example, in Switzerland, social workers work very hard to get, mostly youngster, an apprenticeship. So, they are kept busy and usually happy. By placing people to jail for a long time, they loose the contact to the outside world. Therefore, trying to keep them outside doing the activities they were doing before the crime, would be a reasonable. In other words, these citizens could wear electronically sensors, so that the judicial services can check on them. That would be a win-win situation for the government, society due to the lower cost compared to the jail expenses and for the individual who can continuing with his/her life.
In brief, despite some circumstances for jailing an individual, I believe, that alternative ways of punishment should always be on option depending on the degree of the crime.",7.0
"The graphic gives information about the passenger numbers of an Underground Station in London during the day. In general, the number of passengers increasingly rises and rapidly goes down during the day. Nonetheless, at lunchtime and at nighttime the numbers of passengers are almost stable.
The number of passengers during the day is subject to dramatic changes. Indeed, after 6 am the number of people taking the underground picks up passing from 100 people to 400. The passengers decrease immediately and in less than an hour there are just half of the passengers (almost 200). A specular situation happens during the afternoon. Indeed, the number of passengers at 4 pm is less than 100. They start to increase notably and in less than two hours (at 5 pm) there are almost 400 people in the station.

"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.",9.0

"Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :
1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.
2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.
3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.
4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.
5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.
6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.
7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.
As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.",5.5

"The huge discrepancy between the rich countries and the poor ones is a constant of our society over the years. Although rich countries give financial supports to the poorer, it seems the problem of poverty is far from find a solution. Some people suggest to opt for other kinds of help. I partly agree with them, and I argue that financial skills and intellectual support should be integrated to the economical help the countries sent to the Third World.
Financial support is surely essential in order to help the poorer country to sane their situations. However, money without managment abilities are not useful enough. Indeed, governement of the so called Thrid World, since they do not possess managerial and investment's skills have no chance to make productive the money they used to receive. They can spend the money to solve the immediate issues they have to deal with without caring of the future perspective. For instance, nowadays countries used to send economical help to African countries. How do the poorer spend the money they receive? They built hospitals, schools and buy medicines and the primary necessity products they need. They cannot do more. This involve that as soon as the money and the resources they bought through them are finished, they cannot even mantain open hospitals and schools. They are again in poverty.
What then do the poorer country need? Economical support is not enough. They need also professional people who have to teach them the managerial skill they need. For the development of their countries, it is essential to understand how to invest the money and how to make more money starting from the support poorer used to receive. They cannot do this by themselves, rather they need to be guided through the contemporary economical attituted that the richer countries have been developing over the years. The idea just presented is confirmed by the fact that the countries of the Third World are used to be defined the richer at least from the natural resources they have. Nonetheless, they cannot be able to exploit the natural capital they posses because of their lack of skills. Tanzania, for instance, is a place full of interesting products. However, they have not specialised people able to interact with the richer country in order to start a business. To send money without teaching them how they can use them, it is the same as to give to a child a bycicle without teaching him how riding. Once, a child has learned the technique behind the riding, he will never be worth knowing how to do it.
In conclusion, I believe that countries should integrate the ""how to do"". In other words, althought money are an essential help in order to permit the survival of people in the poorer countries, it is important that those less-lucky countries improve their managerial skills to go out from poverty.",6.5
"There is no argument that history is something related to the past generation which has never been seen by the present generation. which let some people think that history has nothing to teach us or has limited information. While others believe that in order to identify history we have to study it to help us in our modern lives. In my opinion, in the past even if they reach wonderful experiments it could be difficult to reach to our era. However, nowadays we are capable of knowing about the old history via modern technology.
On one hand, old people are limited by the population which let the people in the same place communicate through symbols to be aware of enemies. Towards generations, these symbols turned into history. As a result, people think that it is just a piece of art by the old people. In fact, some of these are from scientists and have been written as a symbol. Moreover, till now those shapes meant nothing to us or are just small pieces of information.
On the other hand, these days the government take a step forward and is trying hard to clarify those stones and what it means, In addition, some historical centers have scientists studying the old tools in order to have an idea from studying that symbols. For instance, Tomes Addison one of his achievement was the discovery of the light lamp which we are used to living with it. Therefore, this exploration comes from studying old history. In other words, each generation is capable to help the following generation.
In conclusion, history is an element that can not be ignored from any period, because it could have very critical information. Finally, I believe that technology helped us recently to study those strange tools. consequently, the government should pay more attention to covering the experiment's expenses.",4.5

"The given picture represents the way how houses around the coastline could be prevented from the flood.
Overall, there are two ways to do this. The first one is using a stopbank. The other one is raising the house under the 100 year flood level. Also we can use a mix of them.
According to the picture, the stopbank is a useful way to prevent flooding by building a little dump between the house and the river. Before constructing it we should know the level of the flood around the previous 100 years and our dump should be higher. Moreover, the stopbank will make an internal pond which will be created by internal runoff, accordingly we should give water to return back to the river via floodgate.
Additionally, it is shown that we could use piles to raise a building above water. In doing this we should carry about 300 mm freeboard between the house flood and the water level.",5.0

Males on an average enjoyed approximately 43 hours of leisure time every week during the given time period and females on the other hand, enjoyed around 38-9 hours of leisure every week, during the same time period.
When we look at the individuals who are employed on a part-time basis, in this case which is females only, they enjoyed a leisure time of 40 hours a week, 1 hour more than the fully employed females and 3 hours less than the fully employed males.

"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskSome people say that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information.

"It is true that artificial activities cause temperature rising. While this is a serious problem, it can be solved by keeping the proper line when we use artificial objects. In this essay, i will write the causes of temperatures rising and solution of these problems.
The main causes of temperature rising is human-made things. First, many people use air-conditional in summer and this can make glaciers melting. There is a study that too much uses of air-conditional are melting the glaciers. When the glaciers melt, the earth temperatures raise 4'C. In addition, nowadays, many people use cars when they go out. This can be a cause of rising temperature. This is because when we use cars, it spread the exhaust gas which influence to the air and temperatures.
However, there are solutions to this problem, one of the ways to solve temperature rising because of man-made is to use proper artificial things. When we use air-conditional in daily life. It is important to remain proper temperature, to 24-26'C. Also, we can wear light clothes instead of using gadgets. Furthermore, when we go to the place which has short distance, we can use bicycles or take a walk instead of cars. On the one hand, people can also use public transfortation when they go to their company.
To sum up, it is clear that continually using artificial objects can make our earth warmer, Nevertheless, the issue can be resolved by using the proper amount of home appliances or reduce the amount of uses of vehicles.",6.5

"Nowadays, more and more people are using their own private car as the major means of transportation. But, overusage of car from people can lead to air pollution and destruction to the environment as greenhouse gases are produced, which are harmful to our body. To solve this problem, many countries are encouraging people to use electronic car or campaigning to use bus or train when they commute.
2 weeks ago, I saw an environmental documentary from the television and I heard the cause of air pollution. There were many factors that could effect the air pollution, but one of the factors was the usage of the car. When we ride a car, the car produces harmful chemical gases such as carbon dioxide that lead to foggy weather. If we inhale this gases often, our lungs will become unhealthy and in worst case, lead to death. Therefore, over-reliance on cars will increase the number of people with lung disease as they produce bad chemicals.
To prevent production of harmful chemicals from the car, many people have to use bus or train for transportation rather than their private car, so government have to do campaign to use them and make festival to persuade people to use public transport. This will help the environment to reduce greenhouse gases and people to inhale more fresh air than before.
In conclusion, many people prefer to ride the private car as it is more comfortable, however, the consequences of usage of car are harmful to the environment and people's health, therefore government should educate or persuade people to use public transports instead of riding a car.",6.5
"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.",8.0
"The provided diagram clearly sheds light on the main differences in the developments occurred on the sharp tools, used for cutting objects, in two distinct eras; 1.4 and 0.8 millions years ago.
Overall, all dimensions obviously show an identical view of both tools ( A and B ). However if details were focused on, many distinctions could be seen.
1.4 million years ago, the three displayed examples of sharp gadgets used for cutting show a dimensional scene of how the tool was innovated. The narrow view of the side angle explain the fact that such tool was an efficient one. With a length of almost 10cm, it was quiet frankly enough to tear any rigid object it encounters. One unconsidered point, is how the front and the back sides were not as thin and skinny as effective as the side angle. But not as essential. The side angle must be designed potentially thin, in case any hard object required a greater sharpness and strength.
In the following 6 million years, the design showed a dramatic change. The whole views had encountered a modification at some point. The front in addition to the rear hand side views; had displayed no changes if related to the side one. Side view showed a significant efficient change, with a smaller, thinner and much sharper angle, such tool became extraordinarly advantageous.

"In my opinion, I consider that science subjects studies are crucial for a better communities and future. There are some countries that should teach science in wider range and value.
There are several reasons why this situation could happen -more specifically- in third world countries. First of all, lack of higher education cirtifactes holder or scientists in the fisrt place could be the reason for the small number of school professors teaching different kind of science subjects. Moreover, some people think of science as an additional subject rather than a basic life knowledge and point on these kind of lectures as secondary subjectes.
On the other hand, in result of the science negligence in these countries, we would see a lower awareness among the society which also affects the rate of science discovery and innovations. In another point of view, increasing the importance of science in life and schools could stimulate the creative minds to exceed further in every aspect of life. There are several suggestions in my opinion is important to implement in the educaion and parenting systems to ensure a adequate scientific base for childern and students. To begin with, we could add the basic subects in schools like; Physics, Chemistry and Biology as a start and then increase the complexity of the lessons and science theories each grade. Additionally, parents could read simple science books to their children from the very first years of life so they can have a good platform to the scientific ideas of the universe.
In conclusion, science is crucial for better life and future, specially to the next generation education systems. So, countries and leaders should enhance that side.",6.0
"Since the middle of the 19th century, English is recognized as the most important language and world common language. There is a variety of advantages because the number of English speakers, including non-native speakers has been increasing across the globe. I strongly agree with this phenomenon.
To go into detail, European countries, such as Switzerland, and Belgium are configured with some languages in one country, such as German, French, and Italian. Therefore, English is categorized as a common language in these countries. In addition, the US and European countries have been leading in a variety of fields, such as science, technology, and academic topics. Therefore, some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and north European countries followed learning English to keep up with technology. Therefore, the number of non-native speakers has widely and drastically increased in Europe to communicate smoothly. As a result, since internet technology has widely spread around the world, Japanese people can search for any kind of information in English more than five times higher than searching for the same information in Japanese. Therefore, learning English is inevitable for Japanese people, as well as other Asian countries or developing countries.
Fortunately, thanks to recent technology, it is getting easier to study English. For example, online English lessons, such as Cambly allows us to learn English 24/7. In addition, in some social media, the name of an app ""Club House"" is a convenient app to have a conversation with the same users worldwide. Therefore, we can easily share cultural differences and tips to improve our English skill.
In contrast, some people are concerned about their own native language might be vanished in the future. In Iceland, although there is a native language, ""Icelandish"" language still remains and is spoken in Iceland, but some people are anxious the language's complex grammar and vocabulary are difficult to explain in some detail. According to the researcher, they are astonished young students are all hanging out only in English, instead of Icelandish. Therefore, the government has been making an effort to maintain the native language by taking advantage of national Media such as, podcast, radio, TV broadcast are only spoken in Icelandish language.
Finally, thanks to English language, more people are willing to communicate with a lot of people who speak English. This phenomenon is not only convenient to understand cultural differences, but also helpful to learn a variety of subject in English for developing countries, like in the Philipinnes. Tagalogue language is limited to cover some vocabulary to learn academic subjects.
In conclusion, English will continuously spread worldwide.",7.0
"It is no doubt the truth that the majority of people want to live in a society where they can derive a sense of satisfaction. While people are ceaselessly struggling to improve society to meet their needs, there is almost always some problems or issues that remain and keep society from being better. In this essay, I try to examine the reason why it is a highly challenging and even impossible task to create an ideal society and give some measures that might be helpful to mitigate the situation.
The first step is to understand why the goal of an ideal society is tough to achieve. One of the most apparent reasons is that it is nearly not possible to give an explicit definition of ideality. Since the desire of each person can be extremely different and individual, their expectations of what an excellent society should look like are immensely varied and sometimes incompatible with each other. For instance, some people wish to have a society of fewer foreign immigrants because of the eventual rise in crime and the more intensive competitiveness in the job market, while others insist that a multicultural society certainly brings vast amounts of merits to the future. Another obvious reason is in terms of the difficulty of realizing the requirements. A prime example is eliminating discrimination against gender or sexual orientation. Although a lot of related laws have been introduced to protect the vulnerable population from being discriminated against, this issue remains one of the most significant concerns that people have and need to face every day.
Despite the complexity and challenges of creating the ideal society for everyone, there is still a large number of things that can be done to enhance the expectations of people toward the society where they live. In my opinion, an ideal society includes at least great tolerance. I believe that education, especially in primary school and kindergarten, plays an essential role in teaching how to treat others with respect, which benefits the tolerant atmosphere in society significantly. One measure that government should leastwise take into account is to fund the more meaningful projects at the school, which publicize and advocate the value of fairness, justice, and kindness.
To sum up, although it might not be possible to create a society that satisfies the whole population regarding the huge diversity of attitudes people hold toward the key consideration of an ideal society, there is still highly necessary to make every effort to make it a better one for all.",8.0

"The illustration below is represnting the parts of a neuron. A neuron cell consists of four three parts, these are the Cell body, Action potential, and the Terminal buttons.
Start with the Cell Body, otherwise known as the soma, it has shape of small ball in its center with tree-roots like lines surrounding it. These lines are called the Dendrites, and theu are responsible for the communication between the neurons. The Dendrites send and recive messages between neurons when physically contacting with each other.
The second part that forms the neuron, is called the Action potential. This section of the neuron consist of the Axon and the Myelin sheath. First of all, the Axon, which is formed as long line extending from the Dendrites, is considred the communication bridge between the cell body and other neurons, muscles, or glands. The second part og the Action potential, is the Myelin sheath cylinders, which are connected with each other as a chain. The Myelin sheath is responsible for covring the Axcon for protection and speeding up the neural impluses.
Lastly, the last part of the neuron is the Terminal buttons, this part recives the neural impluses from the Axcon and form junctions with other cells to send the message.",6.0

Alternatively, the expenditures for food tripled, compared with 1950 and 2010. Specifically, the percentage of food used to be 11.2 percent and drastically rose up to 34 percent.
In addition, there are some expenditures increased. For example, transport, and other. These percentages were 3.3 percent in transport, and 4.4 percent in other in 1950. But both percentages grow up to 14 percent and 19.2 percent in 2050 respectively. Interestingly, when it comes to expenditure in education, there is not a significant change.

"Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to unprivileged countries rather than financial aid.
I agree, for the most part, as we have seen from history, sadly the leaders of those countries aren't always thinking of helping their citizens with the money they got gifted. These world leaders could think of themselves first and satisfy themselves before they do anything else. Sometimes the world leaders don't help, after helping themselves they build their armies, and buy more weapons for more destruction. Before countries decide to help other countries with financial aid, they should analyze the world leader and see what type of world leader they could be. If the world leader shows any signs of selfishness, money won't help their citizens, it doesn't help with their situation at all. When the citizens find out their world leader isn't helping them with the financial aid, they could go violent and cause riots, revolutions, and a huge decrease in currency strength, which will increase poverty, homelessness, and famine.
On the other hand sending resources such as beverages, clothes, and books to help increase the number of educated people in the country would be far more useful. unfortunately, these types of countries have a problem with education among the citizens, many citizens want to educate themselves but aren't able to. Food and clothes help as well, many civilians don't have the privilege to warm themselves up, or get full. This will help with their quality of life.",6.5

It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving.

Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.",7.0

"It is difficult to establish new routine, but sometime it is important. Some people think, that is it important to change our daily life. Conversely, other thinks that does not matter at all and, do not want to change. In my point of view, I think it is difficult to change. However, we have a lot of environmental issues last decade, therefore, we need to change.
Learn new habits and to try new places is difficult as we get older. So, if people arrive to create a meaningful and happyness life, I think it could be counterproductive to change. For instance, if you have a good salary, a beautifull place to live and a lovely family, it is not important to search other things. Cause of, the most important feature of life is to be happy.
On the other hand, the human nature is to evolve. I think, adaptation to his own environment is crucial for deal with the recents climate. Moreover, if we stop to learn new behaviour, we could not be able to adapt sharply for the global warming. For example, one solution about the global warming is to learn news behaviours and habits. That can help to reduce smog and, as we know, our brain are plastic, but if we do not use it, it will stop to work.

"The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.
Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.
Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.
In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.",6.0

"Throughout modern history there have always been professional and gifted individuals from developed countries who aspire to immigrate into more developed societies. Recently this trend has been more emphatic resulting in a disputable discussion which has been widely talked about. Should rich governments permit local workplaces to recruit foreign employees? I personally agree with this point of view and I will elaborate on the reasons in this essay.
There are several possible advantages of hosting employers from poor countries. First, foreign employees can bring with them new innovations and methods of research which in turn will enrich the local markets and possibly contribute to enhancing the knowledge. In addition, foreign employers are generally paid lower income in comparison to local workers, this could save up money for other investments. Moreover, a swarm of skilled immigrants will probably increase the competition among local employers and encourage them to improve in different aspect in order to secure employment.
There are other aspects which merit consideration. Most of the foreign employers would utilize their occupation in the developed countries in improving their skills and knowledge and might consider going back to their homelands. This knowledge transfer would probably benefit both sides. As developed nations will employ the new comers and harness their experience in developing the education, health and other forms. Interestingly, this prosperity in developed countries will presumably lower the influx of unemployed and illiterate immigrants into the rich countries.
To conclude, I agree with the title statement regarding the several advantages of such an action. Historically, if rich countries had adopted skilled people from poor nations, there would have probably been fewer immigrants into their developed countries with all the know repercussions of this phenomenon.",7.5

"Boxing is a sport that draws many visitors and a steady stream of new athlets. But that might be suprising, since it is a violent sport that often results in serious injuries of the participants. As a developed society, who at large condemns fighting, the continued interest can be seen as undermining our values and beliefs.
While using fists to communicate is definitely inappropriate people claim, that this is not what happens in a boxing match. Everybody who steps into the ring consents to the physical altercation and is aware of the risks associated with it. Furthermore, there are precautions taken and a jury in session to make sure nobody gets seriously hurt. Those points cause many fans of the sport to claim, that it is not so differnt to most other sports since there is always a possibility to get hurt. Additionally, one might argue that what two consenting adults do in there past time or as their job is just nobody elses business.
On the other hand, people who don't think boxing should continue, often are convinced that society sets the wrong incentives. The promise of fame and quick money that is often associated with a career in boxing might tempt some to disregard their long-term health for short-term gain. Since socially disadvantaged individuals are less likely to have alternative prospects, one might argue that it is not a real choice after all. Another concern of critics is the corruption of the audience. Frequent exposure to violent entertainment is often connected to a higher likelyhood to become violent.
While I can understand that boxing is not for everyone, I think that the personal freedom of everyone involved should be respected. Because at the end, nobody is forced to watch or take part in a boxing match.",6.5

To go into detail, there are two countries, in Australia, and Denmark where teachers' annual income reached the maximum salary within 10 years. Specifically, The annual income started at 28,000, 45,000 in Australia, and Denmark respectively. Afterwards, the salaries reached 48,000, 54,000 within 9 years, and 8 years in Australia and Denmark.
When it comes to other three countries, Luxembourg, Japan, and Korea, those three countries teachers steadily increased their annual income, however, they kept working after 15 years and reach maximum later. In Japan, and Korea, their annual income gradually increase the longer they worked. For example, the first years' annual income in each country is 34,000, 30,000 in Japan, and Korea respectively. After 15 years, their incomes soared to 65,000 and 48,000. As a result, their maximum income will reach the peak of 37 years, and 34 years in Japan, and Korea. The salary is 86,000, 64,000 in Japan, and Korea.
Interestingly, in Luxembourg, the annual saralies start at 80,000 and increased to 119,000 after 15 years. In contract, there is not so huge gap between after 15 years annual income and maximum. It is 119,000 and 132,000. Furthermore, the maximum salary tend to reach in 30 years. It is a litte bit earlier than Japan, and Korea.",7.5

"The chart illustrates how a cutting tools were changed a million decades ago. Tool A and tool B are related to different year periods, 1.4 million years ago and 0.8 years ago, respectively.
Overall, there were some significant developments made over a 0.6 million year period in the width and thickness of tools, with the latter becoming thinner. The hight of tools did not change at all.
Analyzing tool A, it is seen that it was a massive, not very precise edge-tool. According to the age in which such prickers were made, it becomes clear that the stone was the most common material of almost all things. The stones need to be sharper for good cutting ability, that is why the front, side and back of tool resemble a triangular shape.
In contrast, tool B was expanded, especially it's front and back sides. Analyzing the side view, the cutting tool became much thinner compared to the tool A.",6.0
"Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.",8.0
"The given diagram illustrates how a storage area can be created using concrete canvas.
Overall, the process involves in eight different steps which are manufacturing, delivering, unwrapping, spreading the material on the ground, the use of an air pump followed by the action of watering, setting and storing.
Firstly, the process of creating a storage area starts by manufacturing the concrete canvas which consists of three different layers: the top layer is called the fibrous top surface followed by a layer of dry concrete and a waterproof layer. Next, the material is delivered and unwrapped to be spread out on the ground surface. The spreading process involves in covering an area of 10 metres using pegs and a rope.
Then, under the covered area, some air is pumped through an air pump facing the door. This step is followed by a watering action that reaches 8 metres in height. Finally, the area is left setting for about 20-24 hours until the storage area is created.",8.0
"In modern society, most people believe that money is as important and indispensable as water. As a result, in many countries, people talk more and more about money, such as how much they earn or pay for things in everyday conversation).
This phenomenon, I think is a negative development. And I have three reasons for this:
1. Inner hypocrisy;
2. Lack of confidence in oneself;
3. Thinking and vision.
First of all, the inner hypocrisy. Many young people like to talk to their friends about how much they earn and how many expensive things they buy. At the college reunion, everyone should introduce himself or herself. For example, what kind of work he or she is doing now; Recently bought a house and a car somewhere, and then has to recommend it to others. The core purpose is to say ""I've made millions in just a few years and bought a house and a car."" Although they look nice on the outside, they are empty inside. Therefore, the inner hypocrisy is because they are empty in their heart and have nothing else to compare with others. They can use the money to make up for and satisfy their inner emptiness, and only in others can they find their sense of existence, recognition, and attention to themselves.
Secondly, I am not confident in myself. Many elderly people like to chat about their children while playing cards under the community pavilion. For example: if your child is married; How much does your child earn in a month; Did your child buy you anything expensive? If you answer in the negative, you will be looked down upon, even saying, ""Your children are working such long hours for so little money and they don't buy you anything nice."" These people often talk about it because they are not confident in themselves and they know that their children are inferior in abilities and other aspects. In other words, they are uncertain and reckless. So they like to show off in front of each other and want to prove themselves and their ability to each other.
Finally, the thinking and vision are not high. Every country or place has different classes of people, such as those living in rural China and; Paternal (they all lived in the past); on the surface look good in every way, but only after material things. Because they think money is the most important, money can do a lot of things, and only money can give them a sense of security. As can be seen from this, a person's circle of friends and living environment can determine a person's thinking and vision, so, only if your surroundings are positive, can attract more positive people like you.
In a word, if a person always talks about money, it shows that he is hypocritical inside, not confident in himself, thinking and vision are not high. So. Be sure to constantly improve your thinking and vision, constantly improve your ability in all aspects, and even keep positive at all times, so that not only can attract more people like you, but also your future life will be better.",6.0

Then comes cleaning the materials that has been previously cut and sprayed. The next step is the attachment of Automated IC and soldering of the bords. Then the whole product goes through visual inspection and quality control testing. Then its time for the final testing.

"There is an opinion which is that the longer prison sentences is the best solution to reduce crime. On the contrary, some people say that there are better solutions to solve this problem. Overall, I totally agree with the latter opinion because I think that giving long prison sentences can not directly reduce crime.
Firstly, I observe the advantage about giving longer prison sentences. Surely, people may hesitate to commit crime by strict sentences. Even if they would commit crime, they would have to be in prison for long days. In addition, living in prison for a long time may give a time to reflect themselvs for them.
However, if crimers would be in the prison for a long time, it might be difficult for them to make them living on themselves because they might not be used to the social reality. It may cause them to commit crime again.
In addition to this, I think the poverty and a lot of burdens which people have may cause to commit crime. Because of two reasons, I think that countries have to propose policies which can stimulate economy and relieve their anxieties. Recently, many countries have experienced a recession. It cause the increasing the unemployment rate, so a lot of people suffer from hunger because of the povery. It will be supposed to cause them commit crime such as robbing. Then, people have many burdens because of woriking, raising their children and caring their parens. They have a lot of stress, so even if they could not reduce their stress, they might commit crime to reduce their mental pain. They may want a relax time.
I think the latter opinion is more valid than the former by these reasons. These are my opinion about this problem.",6.0
"Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.",9.0
"With diet and nutrition becoming more and more popular nowadays, the food industry started to attract a significant number of people to join in, students included. While young people today are encouraged by many to pursue knowledge in related fields, some argue that school time should be invested in other important subjects. Personally, I strongly disagree with the latter.
The insignificance of food study is a misconception because of two major reasons. First of all, food is one of our most fundamental needs, but that doesn't make it less important than other fields. In fact, contrary to the common belief, it is actually a subject that still requires much research. For example, we are yet aware of the exact effects of different nutrtients and chemicals on our physiological process. Another problem is the belief that food is not as promising as other science subjects such as biology and physics. However, the statistics said otherwise. In the past decades, profits generated from food industry have been climbing steadily and already overtaken some of the traditional forms.
Pursuing a degree in food science is never a waste of time but its value has become more prominent in recent years. Not only can it help individuals learn more about the mechanism behind food, but it also enables them to lead a heathier life. In addition, as public awareness in health increases, people are paying more attention to what they put in their mouth, so much so that they are willing to pay for a professional to formulate their meal plan, which is a career with great potential for students interested in food research.
In conclusion, students should be encouraged to study the science and procedures of preparing food because it is a topic just as important as any other subjects.",7.0

"In recent years there has been a great deal of discussion about where it is better to shop. A number of people are of the opinion that it is preferable to choose an online shopping according to some modernisations in technology, while others contend that the traditional type of buying things is more effective. In this essay, I shall examine both sides before offering my own thoughts in the subject.
To begin with, buying things online can be much easier compared to conventional type of shopping due to the number of reasons. First of all, almost all people in our world have a connection to the internet where you can find whatever you want, starting from analyzing crucial information, ending with buying products online. The first reason is the fact that you can find a great amount of websites prepared for shopping. These websites have clothes, products, technics and other stuff you need. For instance, people can buy fruits and/or vegetables from other countries, so, it means that they can discover culture of people living there.
As for traditional shopping, it is time-consuming because you need to drive or go around the town looking for things you need. In fact, people who choose conventional type of shopping need a great time of preparation to go there because they need to look good, especially if they are the governor ones or even another important people in area they live.
In conclusion, every person has to choose his own preferable type of shopping because evryone has different opinions. Also, if there were no online shopping, people would have less things the want to buy.",6.0

To leave such a personal subject in the hands of government and school means to ignore a key task of any parent: to be a good role model.Moreover it should be that the social effects of talking about money and finance in a socially diverse school class can be harmful for some students. In my opinion it is more important to teach parents about their responsibilities as a role model and have them educate the children about this private topic in a safe and private environment.All in all I think the main task of public institutions should be to educate about common subjects and not to give such personal advice like the use of money.",6.0
"Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.
Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.
Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.
Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.",7.0

"There is currently a contentious argument regarding the purpose of having cosmetic surgery since more and more people prefer to use this method to improve their appearance. Considering the factors that support the decision to choose this improvement method, there are various reasons which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that there is a positive development.
It is the fact that people have a wide variety of rationales to have cosmetic surgery. An obvious example of this is that people can design their new appearance in the way they wish to be look like. This is because a doctor could perform modern medical techniques such as modifying bone at the patients’ nose to change their real face, which natural face improvement cannot do. Another common reason is the increase in self-confidence. When people have plastic surgery, they tend to believe that their appearance will be more accepted by other people, helping them to feel more confident.
Contemplating the effects of people who have plastic surgery, there are many vital advantages. A common criticism in favour of this is the rise in productivity in workplace. When people feel more confident as a result of having cosmetic surgery, they tend to be more courageous to communicate with people in other departments, leading to the increasing workflow between two teams. Another classic example is building more networking. This is because people who positively improve their appearance tend to attract other people’s attention. As a result, more and more people might want to know them.
In conclusion, it is undeniable that cosmetic surgery could address people’s eagerness to have better appearance and be more confident, which, in my opinion, results in a positive consequence to both society and them. This is because they would have willingness to contact other people and draw other people’s attention to them, which could grow their connections.",8.0

"Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.
On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.
On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.
In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.",8.5

"These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.
First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.
In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.
In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.",8.0

"The bar graphs shed light on impetuses driving people to choose the major of MBA and job applicants' qualities considered by recruiters.
Overall, there are mainly two features manifested by the diagrams. First, satisfactory employment opportunities are the major reason for choosing this degree. Second, personality and relevant academic experience are regarded as the most critical qualities by a majority of employers.
According to the first chart, the percentage of interviewees deeming job opportunities to be the major reason for choosing this major reaches 65%, while any other reason is reported by less than 20%. Notably, serving other people is the most uncommon driving force, reported by only 8%.
As shown in the second chart, the percentage of recruiters valuing personalities most is the same as that of employers attaching the greatest importance to academic experience, each reaching 25%. Other relevant experience and presentation/appearance are reported by 20% of employers respectively. Qualifications are deemed to be the essential quality by the smallest percentage of recruiters, 10%.",8.0
"In the graph that shows the data of the employment rates across 6 countries between the years of 1995 and 2005, the first nation of discussion is Australia.
In Australia, we can see that in the year of 1995, the rate of males getting employed was more than that of females getting employed with males standing at 55% employment, and females on the other hand at only about 25-27% employment. In fact, it can be seen that the rate of employment for males in both the years, 1995 and 2005 is more than that of the females!
Resonating with the point made above, despite the slight increase in the rate of females getting employed, the males still towered the 2005 comparison in the rate of employment, standing at 69%, leaving the females at an slightly increased 39%.
In Switzerland on the other hand, although the rate of employment went to the males in both years of 1995 and 2005, there is only a slight difference between the rates. In the year of 1995, the rate of swiss men getting employed stood at 65% with females only being 8% behind, standing at about 58%. Meanwhile, in the year of 2005, the rate of swiss males employed shot up at a whopping 79%, leaving the females only 10% behind, at about 69%.
Actually, it can be seen that the rate of males being employed is more than females in all of the 6 countries of comparison! Just that the difference of the rates are very minimum in Switzerland in both the years and in UK in only the year of 1995. Otherwise, there is a major major gap in the rates of the remaining 3 countries, that is- Iceland, Newzealand and USA, for both years of 1995 and 2005.",6.5

"Many people claim that home based education is most appropriate for the childrens and their progress, while others believe that studying at school is more import. While teaching children at home might be useful for getting better score and children be more included, I personally am of the opinion that school based education is far outweigh in areas like socializing and it's more important for the future life.
It is often said that when childrens studying at home is better for their development. When student has no distractions such as classmates and school drama and sometimes bullying they are more involved and motivated to study and get good assignments. Moreover, they have less stress comparing themselves to others. For example, during the pandemic of Covid-19 students all over the world were transeffered for home education and this process brought big educational success to all of them. Overall, home base education has one very big benefit among all others, it is the posibility for student to be more focused on education without any distractions.
However, education at school has their pros too and most important of them is socializing. For every person is very important to know how to work, deal and socialize with other people and it's very good when someone can learn it in the school rather than in adult life. For instance, University of Latvia in their research in 2008 proved that students who studied at school are more socialized and are bigger part of the community in their adult life than students came from home based education. In conclusion, school based education is good for styding not only school programm, but also real life.
From my perspective, socializing skills outweight the educational success as it's more important for an adults life.
To conclude, both methods of education either home based or school based have their benefits. Every person should decide for themselves what is better for them or their childrens.",7.0

It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively.

"People nowadays are living much longer.
With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.
Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.
I don't agree with this idea.
Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.
Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?
If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.
The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?
The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.
The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.
Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.
What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?
I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.
I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.
Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.",5.0
"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.
Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.
Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.
As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.
To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.",5.5
"Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.
There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.
The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.
Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.",7.5

"It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.
Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.
Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'
From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.",7.0
"Some people claim that nothing about the past is valuable for life in the present day. From my perspective, it is not true. I disagree with this statement because people can, indeed, learn significantly from previous human behaviours and nature patterns, as it often happens in cycles, in other words, it is repeated from time to time, so it proves that one day the knowledge gained might be useful in the future. Additionally, many discoveries and pieces of research, that were made in the past, applies to the present time.
At first, it has been proved by many geologists that, despite the global warming, the weather follow a cycle pattern. This way, it is possible to predict the future challenges that the humankind will likely face, such as seasons of extremely low or high temperatures. Moreover, the same trend applies to the human behaviours. It is known that some situations will probably be repeated, such as wars and economic crisis, and this is considered part of humans' evolution. Therefore, knowing that many aspects will likely happen, in a similar way, in the future, proves that the knowledge about the past is relevant.
Besides that, it is valid to state that many discoveries from earlier ages, such as the medicines and the technology advance, are vital for nowadays life. People should not take them for granted, as most of the things that the global population has achieved, once, depended on the previous researches.
In conclusion, individuals should, indeed, learn from the past. Firstly, because some situations can, similarly, happen again, and secondly, because it is the way to fully understand our recent achievements and our modern life.",8.5
"Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.",7.0

"Nowadays, more and more criminal activities and violent events are showed on television and in newspapers. Some people consider that we should restrict those kinds of information because of the adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, those events shown in the media should not be restricted for the following reasons.
Firstly, reporting of criminal activities and other violent news can reduce crimes. If those criminal and violent information can be showed to the public, people can clearly understand the whole process and detailed scenes of crimes, provoking them more easily think critically serious consquences. Abusing durgs, for example, people will be afarid of the severe effects on both social and personal areas when they vivily see real outcomes it may bring, thus prevent them from committing criminal acts. Hence, there will be fewer criminal activities or violent events occurring on our society. That is why we should not restrict criminal activities being shown in the media.
In addition, restricting the criminal activities may lead to a high rate of crimes. If people cannot easily obtain those information, they may consider that no one care about it and even take part in some criminal activities without thinking. Because they cannot image detailed impacts on social and personal aspects when they think wether can do it or not. Finally, to a large extent, they may commit cirmes and cause some severe consquences, which may bring nagative effects on society.
In conclusion, I agree that we should show criminal activities and violent events in the media , which can largely reduce crimes. Moreover, we should also think much more about that restricting this kind of information may lead to a high rate of crimes.",6.5

"Nowadays, more and more news of crimes and other kinds of violent events were explosed. Some people think it is not good to report them on television and in newspapers beacuse it can have adverse outcomes. However, in my opinion, we should not restrict this information because of the following reasons.
At first, showing the violent events can decresae some serious crimes. If the public can directly get the criminal informations, which lead to a whole understanding of the criminal process, provoking them more easily to thinking critically inculding the bad effects on social and personal areas. Take abusing drugs for example, people will afraid to touch drugs if they can vividly see the serious outcomes of abuse, which can effectly prevent them to do some crimnal things. Thus, there wil be less crimes and other kinds of violent events happened in our society.
Secondly, restricting the news of crimes to the public may increase the rate of crimes. Take it into more detaily, If people cannot directly obtain the criminal informations, they maybe cannot analysis the the broad of law, thus easily drop into crimes. When they have to choose whether to do or not, they can not consider more details of the serious outcomes for different kinds of criminal events and they just do it. At last, leading a severe consquences which have adverse impact on both social and personal fields.
In conclusion, i agree more with this opinion that we should explose the crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers, which can stop the crimes or decrease the rate of crimes.",5.0
"In recent years, the crisis of food wasting has drawn the attention from all over the world. In my perspective, there are reasons to this problem and some measures should be taken into effect to reduce the amount of wasted food.
Franklly speaking, based on my observation, there are several factors that leads to the food-wasting crisis. Firstly, with the aid of modern technology, especially those related to farming industry, we can get much more stable access to all kinds of crops than our predecessors, which means we no longer need to live in a food-saving lifestyle, thus leading to a number of wastes in terms of food. Secondly, due to lack of educations on saving food in school, the youngsters nowadays tend to be unaware of the importance of adequete food. As a result, people are used to order more amount of food than they actually need, constituting more food is wasted everyday. Finally, as the burgeon of economy in most countries, the fashion of showing off to others is curved into the mind of pubilc, resulting a number of extravegent consuming that could cost plenty of food wasted.
Since the problem of food wasting is taking place everywhere around the globe right now, it is urgent for us to take some actions to deal with the problem. In my opinion, as it is impossible to reverse the development of science, we should then focus on educaitions, specifically children's education. For example, several lectures could be given to the elementary school students to highlight the hardships to grown crops for our ancestors, as well as the reason why we should save the food we eat everyday. On top of that, the autorities could organise the student for some visits to the farming field, where they can learn the basic knowledges needed for farming industry and then understand how harsh it is to grow food that is sold on market nowadays. Once the children aware of the importance of saving food, there certainly will be less food thrown away on a day to day basis.
To sum up, both technologies and lack of public education give birth to food wasting. Althogh several methods could be taken to deal with the problem, it is through our joint effort to reduce the food thrown away everday. Actions need to be implemented swiftly.",6.5

"Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.
Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.
In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.
Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.
In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.",5.5

The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.
The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink.

"The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.
Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.
Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.
Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.",6.0
"It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.
First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.
Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.",7.0
"For some people home schooling is considered to be the right decision for kid's development, meanwhile other people believe that is important to send children to school. I think that sending children to school give them a great advantage not only in their academics but also in their development and social skills.
Having children at home and be their teacher is not easy. Although, it may be important for their development. A good side of home schooling, is the chance to be more connected with your own family and being able to manage your own time without having strict schedule. This means that you don't only have to study the subjects that are for example taught in school, but also it gives the children a chance to invest their time in activities in which they are interested in.
On the other hand, sending kids to school gives them the chance to interact more with other people and develop social skills. They have more opportunities to create connections and interactions with other students with the same age and also it might be considered more helpful to be in the same situation with others, so that they can learn to help each other.
However, in my personal experiece being in a class with a lot of students can be hard. Find the ""right people"" to be with might be challenging but at the end it is satisfying, because you might also end up having friends for life and creating good memories,
In conclusion, these two different methods are both acceptable, as long as the child best interest is done, no matter if his being teached at school or at home.",6.5

"It is a face that people love to talk about money such as income and price of things in this modern society. In my view, there are some reasons in both physical and mental aspects, and it will bring about negative effect if it develop deeply.
Money is required when we live in this society while we have limited ability to earn money. Therefore, realistically, all of us cannot avoid to count our money when we spend it. Also, in macro view, the government also care about it. the figure of GPD issues every year for measuring wealth of a country. Populace pay attention in it not only because of the international state of a country but also because of the welfare of people. Regarding mental reasons, people generally think that the ability of earning money is related to the success of their life. Moreover, people like competition. So we always compare our level of income with our friends or companions.
However, I think that this is a negative development when people deeply concentrate in it. First, I do not agree that money is everything. As a human being, embodying ""freedom"" is the highest value in our live. So I believe that accomplishing the mental achievements is more important that physical target. Otherwise, people will become heartless because they think that money is the only criteria for measuring how useful of a human. For example, we can help and take care of others as volunteers without any payment, and turn the topic of conversation from money to life.
In summary, Although money is necessary in our daily life, it turn us to be ruthless if we cannot control it well. So we can do some meaningful events with our friends rather than talking too much about money.",6.5

"Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.",8.0

"In recent years, more people tend to move to big cities from the countryside has been increasing extremely, especially developed countries, including Japan. Therefore, the total population in the country seems to be not changed, but the balance of the population has been widening in a few decades. I would like to share some example in Japan and suggest ideas to reverse its population in the countryside.
Mainly, job opportunities in the big cities are much higher than in the countryside. The majority of companies and foreign company branches tend to be located in Tokyo, and Osaka. Therefore, people need to move to the big cities or suburbs area to get their jobs. This means that real estate, house, and apartment prices have been soaring drastically. Moreover, the phenomenon connects to the prices rise up in a variety of industries. For example, the food prices in the restaurants need to raise due to monthly tenants payment has been surging. Therefore, people can easily get or change their job in big cities, it is not necessarily wealthy.
Nevertheless, ironically, since Covid-19 widely spread worldwide, many companies launched remote work. Even now, the majority of people do not need to commute to the office. In addition, some companies declare that they never change the working system in the future, because they have already systemized the IT system which is able to work remotely. Therefore, this is a great chance for the Japanese government to dissipate the population in local cities. If people start to move to local cities or countryside, the population in the local cities or countryside increased. It will be not only helpful for people to live there with reasonable prices, but also for effective economic growth in the local cities and countryside. In addition, the local governments will be able to organize the infrastructure, roads, medical care, and education. As a result, the quality of the infrastructure will be close to the big cities.
Finally, if the government financially supported this remote working system to companies, the above phenomenon will be available. As a result, the disparity of wealth will not be wider, and people will be able to get job opportunities with living in the countryside.",5.5

"With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.",6.0

For instance, even if this team had a sizeable gap of points for the first 2 years, it seems to decrease until 43 points in 2003. As a result, Team A was not far to be ahead of Team B which over the 3 first years had a steadily growth of points.

"In recent time, it is observed that the number of students enrolling for Science or Mathematics in higher education is decreasing all over the world. There are plenty of reasons that are causing this decline which will affect the society negatively. In this essay, I will discuss why the number of pupils is deacreasing who prefer science stream and what will be the impacts on a community if it continues.
The main reason of this situation is lack of trained science and mathematics teachers. STEM teachers are not able to kindle the joy of learning among students. If students do not get proper foundation and motivation in their school life to pursue STEM subjects, they will develop Math or Science phobia. Subsequently, they will rather prefer other streams to complete their higher education.
Eventually, this situation will impact the scociety in many ways. Firstly, there would be scarcity of doctors all over the world which will affect health sector dramatically. Eventually, people will suffer with many health problems. Secondly, if students do not take STEM subjects in university, there will not be STEM teachers to teach future generation. According to me, government must take firm steps to avoid these situations in future. There must be some training program to keep STEM teachers up to date to enhance their teaching. This will enable teachers to make science subjects enjoyable for students, for instance, teachers may incorporate technology in the learning process.
To conclude, I believe that government and teachers should take the resposibility to create the conducive environment to learn these subjects in fun way. This will, eventually, increase the number of students enrolling for STEM subjects in recent future. Otherwise, it may have negative impacts on society which will not be a good sign for any country.",7.0
"Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.
Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.
Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.
Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.",7.5
"Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.
To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.
In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.
To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.",7.0
"The given chart illustrates the percentages of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. The information provided is divided in four different activities: dressing, homework, playing gamnes and preparing for bed. In addition the information is segregated by sex when actions are done separately.
The activity where parents spend more time together is playing games with their children. They dedicate almost 70% of the time spent in this activity together. In the opposite side we observe the activity of dressing childrens which is developed by parents together only 20% of the time.
Homework is developed by both parets almost a 40% of the time spent and preparing children to go to bed 50% of the time spent.
If we make a comparison of mothers versus fathers, there are two activities where women spend more time than men: dressing and homeworg. I would like to pinpoint the large difference in the dressing activity where women dedicate more than 70% of the time spent whilst men only dedicate approximately 2% of the time spent.",6.0
"Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay.

"There is no doubt that these days more people is learning and talking by English language. The question is, is this viral of English has a negative view or not? In this essay I will discuss and draw my personal conclusion.
In terms of advantages there is many. Firstly, this spread of English language wil make the communication easier more than before . In other words, travelling to a new country that you are not speak there language is not a big problem these days because most of people are speaking English or at least know the main essential questions and there answers .To illustrate, If you are travelling to Italy you don't have to learn Italian language your English will be enough. Secondly, some languages are hard to learn like Chinese and Turkish, so using the English as a united language is much easier than using other language.
Moreover the massive spread to English may had some disadvantages the main given reason I support this claim is that the consist of using English language in countries will make some other languages disappear. To illustrate, some countries now are choosing not to speak with their naive language and replace it with English in work and school and all daily conversations. On other hand, some countries like Turkey most of their citizens will ignore you when you don't ask them with Turkish.
In conclusion, although this spread of English may diminish other languages, but still having English language is important. That's why I believe that using English is essential especially if you are working with international companies and collegues.",6.0

"Many people smoke although they know how harmful smoking is. This essay believes that smokers continue to smoke because they are addicted to nicotine they smoke from cigarettes, and government should launch a campaign saying that smoking can make smokers become nasty or unpleasant to help reduce smoking in society.
Many smokers cannot stop smoking because they are addicted to nicotine in the cigarettes they have smoked. Nicotine makes smokers feel relaxed and calm when they smoke and makes them addicted to smoke when they feel they need to relax themselves. For example, many people smoke when they feel stressed and when they smoke they feel more relaxed and get some new work ideas according to many smoking survey reports.
It is difficult for smokers to quit smoking, so it should be government responsibility to help them and make smoking situation in the country better. Government should launch a campaign that makes smoking habit be nasty and unpleasant for non-smokers in the country. If smoking habit is not acceptable in the society, smokers will not want to do so at least in public because they want to be accepted by their friends or people in the society. For example, in Thailand, government launches a smoking campaign saying that smokers smell bad and it makes smokers uncomfortable to smoke because they do not want to be smelly people and unfriended by people.
In conclusion, people continue to smoke because of nicotine addiction, and it is important for government to take serious action, such as releasing a changing-mindset campaign, to help society deal with this situation.",6.5
"The shown diagram illustrates information about the process of collection and filtration of rain water in an Austrailian town.
The process starts after the rain drops slip at the roof of the houses and then enter the pipes which is connected to the under ground system for water treatment. As these drops flow in the drain, they directly move towards the water filter. After the filtering process ends, water is then passed to a storage where it can be stored and then transfered to the next procedure. When the water slides from the storage and moves to the water treatment tank, a small device at the top of the tank produces chemicals in order to clear the water from any additional wastes or bacteria that the water filter was not able to clear before. Finally, the loop ends when the water is treated and moves back to the pipes which is the connection between the water treatment system and the houses. People can now have a drinkable water in different sections in their homes.
To sum up, the process of producing a filtering water starts with the pipes that collects the rain water and also ends with pipes that delivers the drinking water after it passed all the treatment procedures within the under ground system.",7.0

"Nowadays, with the development of education, more and more students go to colleges for academic learning. However, some people consider that we should provide more vocational courses because a lack of practical workers such as electricians and plumbers. Personally, I think academic study is obviously important bacause it can improve the technology and the misunderstanding of job-not the lack of vocational training- is the main reason for a lack of labored workers.
It is no doubt that the academic learning in university can induct the practical training and provoke the development of technology in different areas such as agricuture. If we deeply understand the theory of academic knowledge and reasonablely apply them in different fields, we could efficiently improve the technology and help human beings to increase their living standard. For instance, the development of drones turly improve the quantity of crops, which is benifit for famers. However, this technology need a lot of basic theories to invent the drones and teach worker to handle this machine. At this time, the academic study becomes much more important for practical workers.
Some people claim that it is because a lack of vocational training, thus leading to a lack of qualified worker. However, in my opinion, I think there are mainly two reasons come from the misunderstanding of jod cause this bad situation. For one aspect, some people think that practical workers usually cannot earn much more money compared to empolyees working in office. Thus, they just give up this occupation for their career. For another aspect, some people do not respect those qualified worker, which make them feel their job are secondary. At last, there are no more people would like to choose this type of works.
In conclusion, I think academic study is very much important for students to improve the technology, and the lack of practical workers is not because of less provided vocational training, but the misunderstanding of job between some people.",6.0
"Ethanol fuel is produced from corn, a popular grain grown in most parts of the world including South America and Africa. The process of producing ethanol fuel starts with storing corn in large barns made out of plastic and wood. This is to prevent moisture from damaging it.
From these large barns, corn is taken to a milling plant where it is cooked for 4 hours. During the cooking process, water is maintained at a certain level to ensure that the corn is always submerged in water while boiling.
The cooked corn is then fermented for at least 48 hours. This is to prepare it for separation of solid by-products and the liquid drawn from the cooked and fermented corn.The solid by-product is dried to be used for other products like chuka, a cornflake-like snack eaten by children. However, the liquid is further purified into ethanol. The prosess of purifying the liquid into ethanol takes about 5 hours. Purified ethanol is stored in large containers and sealed for safety purposes.
The last part of the process of ethanol fuel processing is transportation. Ethanol fuel can be transported by rail, road or sea to different destinations where it is used.",7.0

It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively.

"Translation softwares are a convenience that we see popping up more and more around us these days. I have seen these being used in daily life around me even very recently. For example, I was recently at the airport to travel from the east coast to the west coast of the US. While there, a passenger in line before me at the luggage drop off had his phone out and was talking to the attendants using his phone. On paying closer attention I realized, he was using a translation software to understand what they said and to respond back to them. It took some effort on both sides, but in the end, it worked!
This is a real-life example of translation software making peoples' lives easier on a regular basis. Witnessing this got me thinking - what would have happened in the absence of this service being available literally on the tips of our fingers. In the absence of this easy access to technology as we have today however, it has come down to one thing - the human capacity to learn and communicate in more than one language.
Coming from a multicultural background where none of my neighbors spoke the same language as me, it was inevitable that I would be exposed to multiple languages since childhood. This is a reality for most metropolitan cities around the world. When I was three years old and could communicate to some degree in my mother tongue or native language, my father ensured I also learned another one of our National languages that was prevalent in the region. By the time I was six-seven years old, I could conveniently speak in two languages. Meanwhile, in school, I was being exposed to the English alphabet in addition to the two other languages which made it easy to learn and understand English too. I can categorically say that knowing all three languages made my life infinitely easier for me since we moved around a lot due to my father's work arrangements.
Later on, during my college days, I met my best friend of eighteen years and was exposed to her native language or mother tongue and since then have picked up a passing knowledge of the language as well. The movies and plays around us while young used multiple languages too and as a result I have a passing knowledge of six languages today. This knowledge not only makes communicating a breeze for me in most areas in my country, it keeps my brain active.
In conclusion, I believe while translation softwares definitely make life easier for us on different occasions, being bilingual, trilingual, or a polyglot serves to make life interesting and easy at the same time. Truly understanding and speaking a language brings to light so many nuanced facets of an entire culture surrounding the language which cannot be translated through a translation software. It has been proven that learning multiple languages helps keep the human brain adaptable and flexible - all marks of a young and active mind. From my personal experiences, I believe that the translation softwares serve as a quick solution to the language barrier for people in general, learning a language brings in a level of richness to ones experience of life as a whole. Translations softwares should therefore not be considered as a replacement for learning a language but as an aide to learning a new skill.",7.5
"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.
Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!
Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.
In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.",7.0
"The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.

As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.
It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.",7.5
"Corporal punishment used to be a very popular method in education all around the globe. In the last century there is an opposite trend, which leads to bans on any physical punishment. I believe any corporal punishment should be against the law in schools and any other facilities.
Recent studies show, that violence is neither most effective nor useful method in education. According to the scientists, any type of physical punishment creates a negative psycological pattern. Students focus on fear and put extra effort into learning things by hard. But students don't use this knowledge or keep it after upcomming test or exam.
Besides, these methods harm students and reduce creativity in the future. Scientists say, that physically abused kids develop psycological disorders in the future life. This leads to an increased suicide rate, higher chance of depression, and lower happiness.
Most importantly, physical punishment doesn't address the core of the problem. There are several reasons for a low school performance: a low interest in the topic, a bad explanation, or a low quality of life. To increase students performance we have to focus on quality of education first. But there are some good news. Humanity made a huge progress since internet and youtube are much more accessable nowdays.
In general, there is not a single piece of evidence which support physical punishment. It's a method from the past that should not be used nowdays. Corporal punishment leads to lower performance, psycological disorders, and doesn't solve any real problem. This is why it shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the world.",8.0
"During the dinner, most of families like to watch news on television or read newspapers. Sometimes these news could be violents and it could be an issues for our childs. Some people argues that they should be restricted. In my point of view, it is important to protect child from these horrific images, but also we need to keep informed them about the world if we want to protect them.
First of all, children and young people need to be protect from these violent informations. One mean to accomplish that, is to explain to them these kind of violent images. Because, they are in fairly part of their development and that could be have a huge impact on their mental health. For instance, if your children saw an image of attentat in a high school, as a result, it could be difficult for him to go back at school further. Morover, he could likely developed mental health problem, as a phobia or anxiety about high school.
On the other hand, it is important to keep inform them about the real world and they need to be prepare for theses situations. For example, if an attack arrived at their school, your children will be prepared for. Conversely, if they did not watched news, and an attack reached the school, they will not be able to protect them and the consequence could be terrible. As far, news allow us to predict the world and be able to protect us and our family.
As far, we have seen it is important to keep contact with reality, because nowadays, our world are violent and as a result, some image could be violent. They need also to be protect from mental health problems, and so we need to explain that they watch and these images.",5.5
"Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. On the other hand, others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. This essay will discuss both views and my opinion.
Some people insist that punishment is a priority as culprits have gone agaisnt ones country's law. When they serve more years in prison, there is no chance for them to re-commit crime. In addition, some suppose that those who can not afford themselves, will feel better in the prison. As prisoners have to live in a systmatized cycle, they do not need to plan their budget and life. There is interview with an offender who continuously commits crime to go back to the prison.
Contemporarily, others say that there are better ways to reduce crime, such as rehabiliation and education. Most offenders lack moral value. Furthermore, they mostly have wrong mindsets or thoughts as some have never been educated properly. Therefore, other people think that education is better way to improve prisoners' behaviour. Society ought to give an opportunity to re-start their life again.
I agree more with the second view. Obviously, we have to punish those people whoever break the law. However, punishment should not be a priority. Education is important. Community need to lead a way for them so that they can re-born as a totally different person. There is a statistics of crimes rates in the United States of America which implicits that strict punishment and longer prison sentences reversely led to an increase in crime rates. Therefore, the government needs to concentrate more on education and rehabiliation rather than security and control.",6.5
"Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay.

"Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.
On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.
On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.

"There has been a lively discussion revolving around the megapolice influence on human health, as some people presume living in large cities results in a variety of problems. In my humble opinion, I consider big-city life to be harmful.
A row of arguments can prove this point of view. The air and water pollution in cities tend to provoke a spectrum of lung and skin diseases. A number of people encountering lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, eczema and psoriasis prevails in megapolicies compared to small towns and villages. Even I have acquired chronic bronchitis while leaving in Moscow. It also must be mentioned that constant contamination of enviroment has long-term consequence for human genetics. For instance, several decades ago the phenomena of allergy was not so widespread. And nowadays, several hundred thousands of people are suffering from it, as their immune system responds inadequately to ordinary things, such as animal fur or dust.
On the contrary, the medicine level in small villages cannot be compared with medicine in large cities. Some urgent problems such as limb break, infection, serious inflammation, heart attack, seizures or appendicits can be tackled only in large cities, where you can call an ambulance and it will come in a blink of an eye, while in countyside it can cause a dramatical outcome. My friend's grandpa in a distant village broke a rib and it stabbed his lung, and, unfortunately, ambulance did not make it in time.

Secondly, we can as community reduce the effect of climte change on our enviroment by different ways. One of them is taking puplic transportion insted of using our own cars. In the matter of transportion, walking or using bicycles are the best for the climte because there is zero carbon monixide release. Moreover, replace the plastic bags with reusable ones will reduce the amount of waste.

Some people speculate that humans have been less connected to nature and therefore are not aware of the detrimental effects of their activities on the environment. Thus, teaching children how to raise up vegetables and how to get along with pets can probably strengthen bonds between children and nature in early phases of life. Furthermore, If children grew plants in early stage of life, they would develop unique creative skills alongside enhancing their productivity. Moreover, some experts claim that treating animals may benefit children as it would improve their social and communicational skills.
On the other hand, there is another aspect which merits futher consideration. Some plants are known to be poisonous and unsafe to young people. In addition, growing plants and spending time on farms might make children prone to a few insects and reptiles which can be really dangerous. Finally, animals could be harmful if they are treated inappropriately.
To recapitulate, as we try to wiegh up the pros and cons of such an enterprise, I still reckon that the advantages of it outweigh the disadvantages. However, in order guarantee the possible advantages I have mentioned upun above, certain safety measures should be taken to offset the potential risks opposed to children as they are in proximity to plants and animals.",7.5
"The table and the graph illustrate information about the number of visitors of Australia in million from foreign countries from 1975 to 2005.

"The topic indicates the international sports events could bring beneficial for a country. There are several aspects to approve as below:
Firstly, international sports events could increase economical income and stimulate domestic consumption. An international sports event usually attracts a lot of audiences and tourists come to host country during the event is holding. A lot of people produce tremendous consumptions which include match tickets, transportation fees , accommodation and shopping costs. Moreover, international sports events will attract many sponsors, both oversea and domestic. They might find the new financial opportunity to extend their further investments in host country. For example, 2018 FIFA World Cup held in Russia where attracted many thousands of tourists flooded into the country and created a huge sum profits.
Secondly, international sports events help to develop country's infrustructures and facilities. For example, in order to hold the 2008 BeiJing Olympic Game China built the nation stadium , nation swimming center and Olympic community so on. Furthermore, the first high speed train started to shuttle from Bei Jing to Tian Jin. In next two decades , more and more high speed trains shuttle in China. Thirdly, an international sports event will efficiently encourage the citizens devoted more passions and enthusiasms to participate in it. For example, Bei Jing is the host city to held the 2022 Winter Olympic Game, which encourage a lot of Chinese to learn and participate these winter sports, like snowboard, skating. Fourth, there is an opportunity to perform various cultures and histories of country to all visitors. Meanwhile, international sports events successfully held in a country that will enhance its international influence and the reputation in international stage.
Generally speaking, international sports events could bring various beneficial development, not only for country but also for individuals.",6.0
"The rain water is collected and goes through an underground water filtering system. The rain water is first collected at the side of the house and goes through a drain which connects with the underground water filter. After the water is filtered, they will be keep in the storage. Then they will be send for water treatment where chemicals are added. After that, the water is back to the house for drinking.
The water filter at the beginning briefly filtered the big particals such as dirt or some objects that can be seen with bare eyes. And the storage after that is to wait for sedimentation of other big particals. On the other hand, going through water treatment, which is the last step of making drinking water, mainly cleans minor particals or molecules in the rain water. And the chemicals are added to kill germs or bacterias that might harm human bodies. After all these cleaning, the dirty rain water can be safe for human to drink.",5.0
"Many teachers believe that an international exchange program would benefit all adolescent students. While there are clear drawbacks to this, in my opinion the advantages are more significant. The essay will demonstrate that pupils will build life skills by joining the program. This is followed by explaining why continuing learning in the domestic school after finishing the exchange can be practicable.
It is obvious that the exchange program is likely to give an opportunity for students to learn to live with people from different society and nationality which is the experience that they are not able to have when studying in their country. As a result, they will have the ability to communicate with various types of people and handle challenging situations. Furthermore, there is research indicating that pupils who study in another country are able to lead a group of acquaintances under pressure.
On the other hand, those who oppose this may point out that when the exchange complete and the students resume their courses in the domestic school, they are perhaps unable to keep pace with others and, consequently, there might be some students who cannot pass exams. Nevertheless, the aforementioned issue can possibly be addressed by teachers to arrange extra classes for the students in order for them to learn about what they have missed when they attended the exchange program.
In conclusion, despite the fact that some students may find difficulty in carrying on studies in the school after the completion of the exchange, I am convinced that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. This is because children are likely to gain valuable experience which they can only have when studying aboard.",6.5
"The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.
On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.
On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.",6.0
"Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work.

"The role of colors in our psycological life is crucial. Some people suggest hence to pay attention on color schemes when workplaces or hospital are decorated. I agree that colors affect people's psychological health. A particular place's decoration can arouse a determinate feeling that could favour or penalise the capacity of people in a work place.
Colors affect our psycological life. They possess an extraordinary social role. It is not a case that the famous table of emotions is presented in different colors where the different colors represent different emotions. For instance, blue incline people to be sad while red is said to be the color of passion, and move strongly the emotions of a person by setting of her pleasures. Lastly the grey's shades stimulate anxiety. Therefore, I think that the hospital's walls or officies cannot be decorated in grey or blue as long as it is better to stimulate their positiveness and productivity. Thre is a curious story about Princess Sissi, that confirm the impact of color in our life. She was obsessed about her wight and fitness. For this reason, she decored purple all the walls of her appartmanets. Indeed, pourple is said to be the color which stimulates the absence of hunger. Thus, when the princess was there it was easier for her to be fast.
By contrast, there are also some colors that stimulate fantasy, creativity and peace. Green is one of that color. Then, to decorate hospitals with green shades could be a good way to produce positive vibes in people who are sicks. Moreover, yellow is defined as the color that describes the feeling of being proud, aware and confident. Then, using this color in the walls of the officies will stimulate workers to do their better. Their capacity in the work-place will be maximased by the general environment.
In conclusion, I believe that colors affect our psychological life and then people should pay attention in the feelings they stimulate when they decore a room or a building intented to welcome a particular type of people like sicks people or workers. Psychological life is important and relevant as the physical one and colors can affects our moods as well as physical accidents do.",5.5
"From the chart, we can easily find four household activities that parents do with their children, resepcetively dressing, homework, playing games and preparing for bed.
In terms of dressing, mothers have a very high percentage of participation of over 70%, while fathers seem to have little involvement in this part (less than 5 percent). Homework is also where mothers alone devote more time with the children(roughly 50 percent) compared with only 10 percent for fathers, and both parents together have also spent some time helping kids' homework(aruond 35-40%). When it comes to playing games and preparing for bed, it looks like more like a family activity since the participation of both parents, respectively 70% and 50 %, outpercentages that of a single parent in total. Also, Playing games is an activity that mothers alone spend the least time with their children compared with other activities, which only occupies around 25 percent of the total time.
In conlusion, we can clealy see that fathers fail to spend very much time with their kid independently as all the data reveals a less that 10 percent devotion of time. Meanwhile, both parents can do more in dressing and homework to further their relationship with their kids.",6.0
"In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.
Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.
On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.
In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.",6.5

"Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.
First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.
Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.
Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.
Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.
To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.",6.5
"Nowadays, smoking has become very common in many individuals. Although governments have been trying to prevent people from smoking by displaying many warning advertisements on medias, people struggle to stop smoking. There many reasons that explain this, like the addiction of tabasco, the social effect of smoking, and the lack of awareness about the effects from people. However, many ways to reduce smoking on society exist like the promotion of physical activity as well as medical treaments.
Evidence strongly shows that the habit of smoking is triggered by the addictive side of tabasco. In fact, studies demonstrate that tabasco contain substances that affect areas in the brain which are reponsible of the feeling of pleasure and addiction. Thus, smoking becomes more and more pleasant and addictive. Moreover, smoking is a way of socialization for people. In fact, many individuals enjoy being gathered and discuss while they smoke a cigaret. They find it very relaxing and pleasant, so they do not plan to stop it as it allows them to meet new people for example. Nevertheless, I believe that the lack of awareness from people about the negative effects is a major component that explains why people do not want to stop smoking. Indeed, many surveys show that people do not know that smoking has several negative effetcs. They know about lungs cancer, despite it seems not to afraid them, but tooth and throat issues are less known in the vast majority of smokers.
However, many ways exist in order to encourage people to stop smoking. In my opinion, physical activity and medical treatments are the most effective. In fact, governments have been investing a lot in the promotion of physical activity by the means of advertising campaigns. For instance, in the USA, surveys show that there is an increase of 20% of people doing physical activity in order to overcome their addiction issues related to smoking. Moreover, medical treatments have been improved over the last years so as to help people to cope with their addiction with smoking, and studies show that treatments are becoming more and more effective. For instance, in France, the number of smokers has decreased, and medical treatment is the second reason to explain this phenomenon, behind physical activity.
To conclude, even though there are many reasons that explain the addictive behaviours of people to keep smoking, I believe that there are several ways to improve this situation, particularly by the means of physical activity and medical treatments.",8.0
"Nowadays, with different advanced technologies development, it is common to see that people can search on a range of information online. Perhaps some people believe that there are more transparent in distinct research and information. However, some critics concern about some imformation not being shared freely as well. This eassy will discuss both these viewpoints in the following paragraphs.
First of all, people tend to the more information the internet has, the more benefit the users get. This means that people will become more proficient in their majors and works due to gaining a lot of relevant resources online in different areas. A case in point is different professional like managers, doctors, teachers and lawers can require a wider range of references to complete and reach their working goals as well as improve the workplace situation. Hence, it is highly likely to see that it may good to share as much information as possible online.
Conversely, some critis argue that if every information shared freely, it would harmful to academic development such as intellectual property. This is to say that when people missused these kinds of information, there would occur plagiarism much more easily. A good illustration to my point is some university students would copy different resources to their eassies in order to get a higher sorce or avoid some complicated experiments. Even some companies will copy another products design from their opponents. Therefore, it is possibly to say that in bid to protect their intellectual property, some information must not have shared by free.
To summarise, it is hard to say that which sides of opinion is the best. But even so, in my point of veiw, the key is moderation. What means by this is when people want to share their opinions as well as reseachs online, they should make an informed decision for sharing it freely or not. Unless they take this measures, the conflicts will never stop.",5.5
"With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.
Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.
However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.
To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.",8.0
"The pie charts indicate the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007. Clearly, homeowners have the highest percentage in 1991 and 2007. In addition, the number of homes increased from 1991 to 2007.
To begin with, the total number of homes in the UK increased. It was 22 million and five million homes added in 2007. Home homeowners occupied three-fifths in 1991 and increased the percentage to approximately three-fourth in 2007. Specifically, the percentage was 60, and 70 in 1991 and 2007. These percentages were much higher than the second highest percentage, social renting. The social renting was close to a quarter in 1991. And it can be seen a slight reduction in 2007. It is specifically 17 percent due to the increase of homeowners.
Another interesting point is private renting. The percentage remained the same in 1991 and 2007. It is 11 percent. When it comes to social housing, it was six percent in 1991, but the percentage plummeted to two percent in 2007.",7.0
"Here on this scheme we're observing the whole diversity of forests cutting consequences, from the threat of flooding to the biodiversity decreasing.
First of all, the deforestation is horrible thing for soils, its richness and fertility. Because of forests cutting soil becomes harder and it looses its ability to absorb the water. As a result we could face the flooding after strong rains. In addition soil starts to erod and we can see the vegetation degradation in this area as a result.
Secondly the most important consequence of deforestation is biodiversity decreasing. The land without enough quantity of trees can face drought and fires. The vegatation will be degraded in a couple of years and a lot of species won't have an ability to stay there and find nutrition.
As a conclusion, it's possible to say that we always need to evaluate all of the consequances of forest cutting before doing it. Probably the total cost would be so high that it would be cheaper to keep forets safe.",5.5
"The bar chart depicts the figure for men and women who joined four different evening classes at an adult education center in 2009 while the pie chart illustrates the proportion of participants’ age, divided into five groups.

"Information is presented by a bar chart which compares the total spending on three particular purposes, classified by 5 different age groups of citizens in the UK in 2004. Overall, it can be clearly seen that while the popularity of food and drink, and entertainment increased as people got older, the demand for restaurant and hotel changed in the opposite direction.
Turning to the first main feature, people who were under 30 years old were the majority group that spent on restaurant and hotel, amounting to just below 15% of the total spending, whereas older people in the 61-75 age group spent on this category the least, accounting for approximately 2%. In addition, there was a little more than 10% of the total spending which was contributed by people who were in the 31-45 and 46-60 age group equally.
Turning to another main feature, in terms of food and drink, there was only just above 5% of the total spending, paid by people who were under 30 years old. Nevertheless, the expenditure ratio rose as the number of age was higher. The largest proportion of spending on food and beverage was about 23%, contributed by people who were 76 years old or over.
Focusing further on the last category (entertainment), the proportion of the total disbursement grew when people were older. There was just a little more than 5%, spent by people who were below 30 years old on entertainment. However, the ratio of the spending on entertainment rose to around 23% for people who were in 61-75 age group, which is the highest percentage and also the same number as that for people in more-than-76 age group who spent on food and beverage.",7.0
"In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.
Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.
It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.
As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.
In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.",6.5
"The table chart gives information relative to a sample of 100 people in seven countries about the number of mobile phones and landlines. In general, there are more countries in which mobile phones are more used than landlines. Nonetheless, there are three countries in which the use of landlines is more spred.
In 5 countries out of 7 there is a high number of people who possess a mobile phone. In particular, in Italy 90 people out of 100 have a mobile phone. Sweden and UK immediately follow Italy with numbers that do not go under 80. The higher number of people with a mobile phone in Italy, UK and Sweden compensates the lower number of landlines, which does not exceed 70. Although, the number of people possessing a mobile phone is 70, even in Germany the use of mobile phone is preferred. Indeed, landlines are used by 60 people.
By contrast, there are three countries is which the number of people that use landlines is higher than the number of those who use mobile phones. The case of Canada is peculiar because it is the country with the lowest amount of people that use either mobile phones or landlines. Specifically, less than 30 Canadian have a mobile phone, whereas more than 60 use landlines. US's case is pretty similar to that of Canada. On the opposite side, Denmark is the country in which the number of people using landlines is the highest (almost 90 people) but there is no discrepancy with the number of people that use mobile phones (more that 80 people have a mobile phone).",6.5

"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.
Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.
It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.
Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.
In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.",7.5
"In developed country, economic wealth is not an issue for them. Some people argue that more growth in economics won't provide additional satisfaction to its citizens. I partially agree with this viewpoint that any additional economical growth will have a diminishing returns in developed country. However money is still the driving force to well-beings.
The statisfaction level of the citizens in developed country is driven by many factors. Economical stability is of course a very important one to consider. However, there are other factors such as health care systems, education systems, and enviormental protections. These are also equally important to the financial stability of one country. Degree of satisfaction for citizens should be measured in many aspects.
On the other hand, economic wealth is the main fundemental to reach beyond just putting food on the tables. For government, any additional wealth can be utlized to slove potential social problems. For examble, there is always money needed to funding hospitals for better health care. Secondly, additioanl wealth can also be used for protection of the country against terriosts attack and war prevention. The military force needs ongoing funding to promote stability and order in the world for developed country. Thirdly, more wealth can be used to develop new technology to better our daily lives. If we need a new breakthrough in high tech industry, government needs more financial support to help scientists doing reseach and development.
In conclusion, I believe the satisfaction of citizens in developed country can always be better off with additional wealth.",5.5
"The map shown provides a rough overview of a proposed town structure. There is a clear distinction between residential areas, industries, roads, parking spaces, transport facilities such as buses, and recreational areas.
The diagram is structured in a circular manner, with divisions being made radially. The proposal suggests that the town be arbitrarily divided into an inner and outer ring by a Ring road. Originating from this, are multiple paths in a spoke-like manner. The internal circle has been divided into four regions, not including the central square and the external ring has seven similar parts.
The internal ring consists of two bus stands and parking areas in the middle of the town. Surrounding these lie homes and a few recreational areas interconnected by straight roads.
The outermost part of the map contains the industries, and housing facilities, separated by more lanes. There are two industries, one each on the left upper and right lower corner of the map. These have been provided their own sections distinct from homes, which occupy the other five subdivisions.",7.5
"Doing sports has become part and parcel of our daily routine , and its beneficial effects are beyond dispute. However, which between individual or team is most useful and salutary is a question that stir up fierce debate amongst public opinion.
To start with, beginning a team sport activity since from the childhood has countless advantages, first of all, it helps connecting athletes one another in an engaging and ever- stimulating experience.
Secondly, by empowering players of sharing tasks with the team, both empathy and discipline will be developed.
Nevertheless, the most common shortcoming of playing in a team is that often one’s overall performance can be restrained by constantly hewing to a strict tactics which leave no room for bold or creative moves, stifling any prospective talent on the rise.
In contrast, individual sports require a precise mindset and the natural flair for breaking the mold along with the urge to take on themselves in a never-ending clash under the banner of “ may the best man win”.
However, anyone can undertake such an activities, whose undoubtedly beneficial health effects, come into their own.
Although the spirit of challenge is equally through the roof in comparison with team sports, the absence of mates to confront with may, in the long run, leads the individual player to become decidedly more reclusive and self-reliant.
According to my experience, I would not have become companionable and self-reliant if I had not joined the basketball team when I was 9 years old. Moreover, playing with others, has helped me to pushing my limits further ahead without breaching those of my teammate, being a sort of example to follow and a beacon to turn to, in case of needs.",6.0
"The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.
To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.
Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.",7.0
"In general, music plays a vital role in our everyday work life. It is said to be the purest form of art but it is often claimed that the main purpose of music is to make people feel relaxed.
Music addresses our psychological, mental, and spiritual needs giving us relaxation. Without any doubt, it is a sure thing that there is no day when a person does not listen to music not even once and this is really helpful for them to reduce their stress after a tiring day at work and our brain produces some healthy endorphins.
This makes them mentally refreshed and also intensifies their moods. For example, I am really passionate about easygoing soul music or folk songs and listen to them with the help of several singing apps. As a result, it soothes my mind and helps to maintain a good vibe. In addition, music has proven its healing power in the medical industry to cure various diseases. Such as listening to the verses of the Quran is being used to cure many psychological disorders.
Furthermore, a variety of authors of songs write them with their emotions when they are happy or sad. People who face similar challenges or situations like in the lyrics of the song resonate with it and that they are not the only persons with the same problems. Nature sings to every single sound that is heard in our surroundings like the chirping of birds, and the sound of heavy rain, and even when a glass is broken there is some sort of music.
To conclude, I think that the most important function of music is to explain life, its beauty, meaning, and feeling. And indeed in relaxing one's mind.",6.0

"With the rapid development of economy and the increasing people’s enthusiasms, sports industry have been gaining the immense profits. It presents not only the professional players and companies with high earnings, also gain reputations in their fields. From personal view, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. But, from professional players and companies, I think the phenomenon is a positive development.
At first, as an audience, a fan or a consumption, I have to pay more costs for watching sports events or purchasing sport commodities than before. For example, the sport shoes from Nike and Adidas have risen in their prices up year by year. Thus, I think the phenomenon is a negative development. Secondly, on the contract, as professional players, particularly some very famous athletes who have a lot of proponents and gain high reputations all over the world. They have the abilities to create wealth. Besides, they have profound influences and authorities which inspire more people to engage in the sport. For example, Lional Messi, a world-famous soccer player, and Roger Federe, an iconic tennis player. Both they have a lot of followers, some of them are willing to contribute their money and passions to these sports. Furthermore, as a sport company, which would like to invest more capital to research and develop the higher quality of productions.

General speaking, sport companies are the dominant sponsors in various sports events. For example, Nike and Adidas company who have strongly supporting many sports events to held annually. Those sports events attract immense audiences simultaneously offer more opportunities to sport players.

"Most vehicles release a toxic amount of fumes into the atmosphere. This, in turn, has grown into an environmental issue of global concern that governments across the world believe can be mitigated by adding on to the price of fuels. I chiefly disagree with the effectiveness of this method as next to nothing had been altered since the policy enforcement due to convenience issues.
The number of cars utilizing fuel has not dwindled. Even though many alternatives had been suggested, there was no mass production of transportation units for the use of average salary workers. The middle crust of society does not possess sufficient income to shift to environmentally friendly solutions for the fear of maintenance hardships. For instance, an electrical car would necessitate a spacious charging spot in front of a garage that not many possess. As a consequence, the more convenient and trustworthy solution to buy fuel is resorted to.
The population of the world as a whole does not stay in one place. As more and more people are born, there is a growing need for transport to be manufactured in a short span of time. Although a part of the population may be able to abandon their cars in exchange for bikes or buses, a significant portion of the growing society still opts for refueling cars in gas stations to get to places faster.
In conclusion, while the idea of the price policy introduction bore few fruits, they had not been enough to make a contribution to solving the carbon footprint. Ironically, people would rather overspend for their comfort than think about nature.",9.0
"The diagram indicates the development of two cutting tools (Tool A and Tool B) in the Stone Age, from a front view, side view and back view. Tool A is a tool of 1.4 million years ago, whereas, Tool B is a cutting tool of 0.8 million years ago.
Overall, Toll A and B were bigger than 5 cm long, were made of stone and were used in the Stone Age as cutting tools. Tool A had a triangular form, whilst, Tool B had a more complex form which is similar to a pentagon.
In detail, the front view of Tool A seems rougher and with less sharpness than Tool B. Regarding the side view, the diagram shows that Tool A was wider than Tool B. Finally, the back view of Tool A shows that this device was thinner than Tool B's back view.
To sum it up, these two cutting tools were similar in material and length. However, Tool B seems that it was a more developed tool, which was thinner in the side view and with a more complex form in its front and back view than Tool A.",7.0
"These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.
In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.
On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.

"From many generations schools are consider as place where major behavior modifications and manners are bulid in a child. One of such important trait is cooperation which helps indiviual in many stages of life to acheive a collebration and goals. Nowadays, it has been taught in schools through several activities but latley the focus is inclined more towards team sports.
To begin with, lots of private and goverment schools do promote team sports such as volleyball, hockey etc. compare to indiviual sports as their are plenty of advantages which are associated with it. Studies have shown that such sports not only help childrens build strong bond among themselves, however it also inculcate other important traits such as disipline, leadership and planning to achieve common goal which can perhaps help them to stand out in society in future.
Additionally, it increase the confidence which is consider as vital quality in any human beign who wants to outgrow of any challanges which comes in his/her way. Students who give equal attention on sports while studying have somehow developed a better time managment trait compare to those who focus only on studies or sports.
On contrary, It has show certain disadvatages to the students who does not find sports as their primary area of interest and are introvert by their inent nature. When such childrens are forced to participate in team sports they either end up loosing their self- esteem or judged by their surroundings.
In conclusion, although their are lots of advantages of team sports at school but they should consider other activities as well which can interest students of all nature so no one feels leftout and all gets equal oppurtunities to participate in every activity.",5.5
"Some people and governments believe in reducing the carbon dioxide of cars and other vehicles is the most effective way to solve the environment problem. Although there are some points also neccesaliry developed except for car and other vehicles, I believe spending the cost of fuel for cars which do not emit detrimental substances play the biggest effect for environmental improvement.
Cars, and other vehicles, such as airplanes are ubiquitous around the world. People rely on most transport type must be cars around the world, even in developing countries. In addition, recent cars released in a few decades tend to be durable and the most of energy is petrol which resource is made of fossil fuel. This means that cars emit carbon dioxide across the globe and the highest volume of carbon dioxide is considered by cars. Therefore, the majority of fact about global warming is caused by cars and airplanes.
Recently, the car industry has become aware of this issue and they are starting manufacturing cars that never emit carbon dioxide. For example, some companies, especially Tesla, and Porsche had already released cars that consume energy as electricity, instead of petrol. This effort will cause a drastic reduction of transmitting carbon dioxide and some countries are planning to regulate laws all cars have to consume energy only by electricity.
Finally, of course, there are other issues that lead to harmful environments around the world, such as deforestation, disposal of rubbish by incineration, and agriculture. For example, growing cows too much will generate methane gas which also relates to global warming. However, there is no doubt the total volume of the environmental problem must be cars; and other vehicles. Hence, it is the most effective to shift energy resources from detrimental and limited to sustainable and clean energy in the car industry must be a valuable first step to resolve environmental problems.",5.0
"The diagram below shows the process of creating perfume.

The source of aroma is aromatic plants, it is the main ingredient. We use steam to get aroma from plants. If we want to get steam, we should use a strong fire. Flame will boil water in the tank.
Using cold water will help to quickly refrigerate hot water in a condenser. This cold water after the previous stage will be entered into the vessel which is called a separator.
